### `.env`

App's configuration, can choose your `${topic}` at NYTimes by the way: edit `COLLECTION=` at this file. Also can change title and main API key of app at here.

### `src`

Root of this app, contain:

- `index.js` the first file, everything comes from here.
- `App.jsx` - the root component of app
- subfolders - the organization of the directory tree of all content that makes up this website, see below.

### `src/actions`

All actions that this app needs. Based on the theory of Redux architecture.

### `src/assets`

Contain all resources this app needs.

### `src/components`

Contain `React`'s components.

### `src/pages`

Contain app's pages.

### `src/reducers`

Contain `Redux`'s reducers. Based on the theory of Redux architecture.

### `src/scripts`

JS libs, contain functions that the app needs to run.

### `src/styles`

Most style files follow their `component` (in my opinion - like: `News.jsx` and `News.scss`). This place contains only special style files.

### `src/templates`

Contain html templates of the app.
